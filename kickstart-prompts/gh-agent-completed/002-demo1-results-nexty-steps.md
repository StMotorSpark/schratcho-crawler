# Overview
We have completed the initial scratch-off ticket demo and run through testing the functionality. Based on user feedback, we have decided to continue forward with the CSS Masking approach for the scratch-off effect due to its simplicity and performance across devices. In addition, we would like to start working on the next steps of the demo to further align with our overall game vision.

# Requirements
- Remove the Canvas API implementation and retain only the CSS Masking approach for the scratch-off effect.
- Enhance the scratch-off ticket component with improved styling to better match the intended game theme.
- Add multiple scratch-off areas on the ticket to allow users to scratch off different sections.
- Implement a "New Ticket" button that allows users to generate a new scratch-off ticket without refreshing the page.
- Add sound effects for scratching and winning a prize to enhance user engagement.
- Ensure the application remains responsive and performs well on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Out of Scope
- mobile development using React Native will not be included in this phase; we will focus solely on the web version.
- Backend functionality or persistent storage will still not be implemented at this stage.
- Advanced animations or effects will be kept simple; the focus remains on core functionality and user experience.
- Detailed UI/UX design will be minimal; we will focus on functionality and basic styling.

# Definition of Done
- The Canvas API implementation has been removed, and only the CSS Masking approach remains.
- The scratch-off ticket component has been enhanced with improved styling and multiple scratch-off areas.
- A functional "New Ticket" button has been implemented.
- Sound effects for scratching and winning a prize have been added.
- The application has been tested and confirmed to be responsive and performant on both desktop and mobile browsers.
