# Overview
As we kick off this project, we want to start with a simple demo to play around with and start laying the groundwork. This demo will be a scratch-off ticket that reveals a prize when scratched. We'll use this to test out our scratch-off mechanics, user interactions, and basic UI elements.

# Requirements
- Set up a basic React application (using Vite for simplicity).
- Create a scratch-off ticket component that allows users to "scratch" the surface to reveal a prize underneath.
- Implement basic styling to make the ticket visually appealing.
- Ensure the component is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Out of Scope
- We will not be implementing any backend functionality or persistent storage for this demo.
- This demo will set up and test the web version only; mobile implementation will come later.
- Advanced animations or effects will be kept simple for this initial demo; we will focus on core functionality.

# Definition of Done
- A functional React application with a scratch-off ticket component.
- The ticket should allow users to scratch off the surface using mouse or touch input.
- Basic styling applied to the ticket and overall application.
- The application should be responsive and tested on both desktop and mobile browsers.
